### A Virtual Theremin Using Kinect
The theremin is an electronic synthesizer that is played without being touched.  Because it gives no haptic feedback, it a natural candidate for virtualization.  In this paper we discuss our design and implementation of a virtual theremin using the Microsoft Kinect.  We demonstrate algorithms that reliably track hands and recognize simple gestures at 30 frames per second.

### An Introduction to Quantum Money
The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of the field of quantum money, from its invention to current results.  We discuss the motivation and history of quantum money, describe the terminology and techniques used to reason about quantum money, and present several proposed schemes for quantum money.  Finally, we show two promising implementations based on these schemes and investigate their security.
